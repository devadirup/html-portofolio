<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, My name is Kemas Angga Putra Perdna you can call me Kemas, I live in Indonesia, I'm 29th years old, and I have finished my bachelhor degree (Islamic Economical)</p>

<p>I Like to study everything, I just start to study web development in 2022 because its very interesting, even though I feel a little late to learn this but I'm still enthusiastic, isn't it better to be late than not trying at all?, I like the preasure in trouble when I got stuck with the code, its make my brain thingking continously and I love it. </p>

<p>I believe there is no useless knowledge, this keeps me learning and getting to know many people to learn from them, I hope I can always use my knowledge to help many people.</p>
